# 🖼️ Intelligent Image Retrieval System Using OCR & Deep Learning 🤖

## 🌟 Overview
This project is an **AI-powered image retrieval system** that uses **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** and **Deep Learning** to analyze, process, and categorize images based on their textual content. 🧠✨ It enables efficient image searches for text-rich documents like invoices, reports, and scanned forms.

---

## ✨ Features
- 📄 **OCR Processing**: Extracts textual content from images using **Tesseract** OCR.
- 🧠 **Deep Learning Classification**: Categorizes images based on extracted text and visual features.
- 🔍 **Intelligent Search**: Retrieves relevant images based on textual queries.

## 🔄 Workflow
1. **Image Preprocessing**: 
   - Resizes, denoises, and enhances images for better OCR accuracy.
2. **Text Extraction**: 
   - Extracts textual content from images using **OCR tools**.
3. **Feature Extraction**: 
   - Combines textual and visual features using **Deep Learning models**.
4. **Image Retrieval**: 
   - Implements a similarity-based retrieval mechanism for querying images.
